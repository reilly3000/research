# Coding clients I've tried

Claude Code:
- Generally very good
- sessions are local to device
- works in IDE

Goose: sux

Cherry: China

OpenCode: fully good, but with issues

Mira: really not setup for coding

aichat - pretty ok but not great agent experience

KiloCode: good stuff. 




I want to try externalizing issues to GitHub.
